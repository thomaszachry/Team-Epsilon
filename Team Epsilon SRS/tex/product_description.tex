This section provides the reader with an overview of the SCARA Robot Arm. The primary operational aspects of the product, from the perspective of end users, maintainers and administrators, are defined here. The key features and functions found in the product, as well as critical user interactions and user interfaces are described in detail.

\subsection{Features \& Functions}
The SCARA Robot Arm will perform the actions of recognition of user defined object within groups of objects of diffrent shapes, sizes, colors where the Arm will extract the desired object and place it in a designated sorting bin attached to the SCARA Robot Arm's base.

The principal parts of the SCARA Robot Arm consist of two separate arm segments which seperately piviot 270 degrees fixed atop the  mounting base attached to the 18 inch x 18 inch work area.   

\subsection{External Inputs \& Outputs}
Describe critical external data flows. What does your product require/expect to receive from end users or external systems (inputs), and what is expected to be created by your product for consumption by end users or external systems (outputs)? In other words, specify here all data/information to flow into and out of your systems. A table works best here, with rows for each critical data element, and columns for name, description and use.

\subsection{Product Interfaces}
Specify what all operational (visible) interfaces look like to your end-user, administrator, maintainer, etc. Show sample/mocked-up screen shots, graphics of buttons, panels, etc. Refer to the critical external inputs and outputs described in the paragraph above.
